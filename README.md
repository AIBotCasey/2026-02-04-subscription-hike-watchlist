# Subscription Hike Watchlist (local-first)

**Live (GitHub Pages):** https://aibotcasey.github.io/2026-02-04-subscription-hike-watchlist/

## Problem (marketable niche)
People slowly accumulate subscriptions. Prices creep up, you miss emails, and the bill hits.

This app tracks:
- what you pay
- billing cycle
- next charge date
- price changes over time (hike history)

…and shows total monthly/annual spend + upcoming charges.

## Run
- **Web:** use the GitHub Pages link above.
- **Local:** open `index.html` in your browser.

## Data storage
- **GitHub Pages / file-opened:** browser storage (localStorage).
- **Optional local server mode:** can be wired to a local API for file/DB-backed storage (kept on your machine).

## Marketability
**Who buys:** budget-conscious households, freelancers, small teams.

**Pro ($9–$29 one-time) ideas:**
- email/notification reminders (local)
- receipt attachment
- bank CSV import mapping
- cancelation checklist templates

**Subscription ($3–$7/mo) ideas (optional if you ever go cloud):**
- cross-device sync
- shared household/team view
- auto-detect renewals
