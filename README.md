# Subscription Hike Watchlist (local-first)

**Live (GitHub Pages):** https://aibotcasey.github.io/2026-02-04-subscription-hike-watchlist/

## Problem (marketable niche)
People slowly accumulate subscriptions. Prices creep up, you miss emails, and the bill hits.

This app tracks:
- what you pay
- billing cycle
- next charge date
- price changes over time (hike history)

…and shows total monthly/annual spend + upcoming charges.

## Run
Open `index.html` via the Kanban Projects page (recommended), or directly:
- http://127.0.0.1:18793/projects/2026-02-04-subscription-hike-watchlist/index.html

## Storage
Uses the local Kanban server API and stores data in SQLite:
- `~/Documents/CaseyBotKanban/caseybot.db`

## Marketability
**Who buys:** budget-conscious households, freelancers, small teams.

**Pro ($9–$29 one-time) ideas:**
- email/notification reminders (local)
- receipt attachment
- bank CSV import mapping
- cancelation checklist templates

**Subscription ($3–$7/mo) ideas (optional if you ever go cloud):**
- cross-device sync
- shared household/team view
- auto-detect renewals
